For the first set of jobs, I need to actively self teach myself as much as I can throughout my college experience. I will need to continue to be an attentive member of ISU Sec and maintain my position there. If I do this I will continue to improve my leadership and management skills, which will be needed for any of those jobs after college. I will also have to keep mny grades as high as I can to ensure my success and good terms with the education system within the IT department. I will also participate in Capture The Flag games online to better hone and improve my cybersecurity skills.  I will have to make connectiuons in my day to day life to ensure that I will be able to get a good job and have good resources at hand in case I need them. I will have to study more about TCP/IP as I have very little knowledge in this area and most of the jobs right out of college require theemployees to need to know some about TCP/IP. I am going to continue with my leadership position within Turning Point USA, as this will allow me to tune my leadership skills. Leadership skills are highly valued in my area of work, so it is essential that I build up my resume, as it will help me to become more highly sought after. For my job that I will have 5-8 years later, I am going to be sure to fully live and work to my fullest potential. I need to do this so that my new employer will be able to look at the work I have accomplished, and then want me for the job. I will have to continue to dabble myself in cybersecurity to make sure I am kept up to date on all things cybersecurity. This is true because cybersecurity is constantly changing and adapting, so I must change and adapt myself to keep up with the world around me. I will also strive to complete my OSCP certificatioin to ensure that I am well rounded. Finally, I will have to be sure that cybersecurity is my true passion, for I cannot work my full potential if I do not enjoy the work that I do.
